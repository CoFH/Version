This is a pretty simple mod. It does what it says!

There's a config file which allows you to use an allow- or denylist for various crops, and choose if you would like crops to be replanted upon right-click harvest. 

It will intelligently handle right click harvesting of all vanilla and vanilla derived crops, as well as more advanced behaviors such as CoFH's perennial and double-height crops.

If there are other mods which need compatibility adjustments, swing by the Discord and ask! :)

### __Configuration__

- _Server_: `right_click_get_crops-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.

Copying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.

Dedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`
