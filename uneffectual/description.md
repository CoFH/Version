This is a pretty straightforward mod and it does one thing:

- Allows you to configure which effect icons you NEVER want to see. (For example, Night Vision). Simply provide a list of resource locations.

### __Configuration__

- _Client_: `uneffectual-client.toml` file located in `/config`

### __Compatibility__

This mod is completely standalone and has no dependencies. It can safely be included in modpacks.
