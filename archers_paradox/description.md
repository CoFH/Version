Archer's Paradox adds a bunch of new arrows, appropriate for both lightly and heavily modded gameplay.

__This mod requires CoFH Core. It can be found here: [CoFH Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cofh-core)__

### __Configuration__

- _Client_: `archers_paradox-client.toml` file located in `/config`
- _Server_: `archers_paradox-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.

Copying this file to your `/defaultconfigs` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.

Dedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`

## __Features__

This section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.

- Lightning: Calls down a lightning bolt, if it hits outside.
- Ender: Teleports player to location; or swaps places with the target.

- Glowstone: Lights up an area for 10 seconds.
- Disruption: Creates a temporary area which teleports things away.
- Spore: Transforms Dirt and Grass into Mycelium in an area.
- Verdant: Transforms Dirt into Grass in an area. Also grows crops/plants.
- Training: No damage, stacks a "Hit Streak" effect, for practice. Distance matters!
- Challenge: No damage, stacks "Archer's Gambit" effect. XP for maintaining hit streak. Distance matters!

There is one creative tab, currently with only the arrows. More content (quivers, archery-themed blocks, etc) will be developed!

For those of you who may recognize some of these icons from another archery themed mod - [Bullseye](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bullseye) - Forstride has very graciously given me permission to carry the quiver forward as it were. Frankly, we had a lot of similar ideas (although mechanically different execution) and Bullseye has excellent artwork that deserves to live on in 1.14+.
