This is a very simple mod - it enables Forge capabilities for the Composter Block, which allows all sorts of various mods to interact with it the same way that they would interact with each other.

For example, the Phytogenic Insolator from [Thermal Expansion](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion) can automatically extract the bonemeal when the composter is ready, as shown below. You'll notice that pistons are still able to move Composters, so there is absolutely no change to vanilla behavior.

This mod has no dependencies but does use mixins! Happy Composting. :)
