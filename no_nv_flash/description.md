This is a pretty straightforward mod and it does a couple of things:

- Removes the flashing effect when night vision effects have less than 10 seconds left.
- The night vision effect can be configured to fade over time. Default is 1 second.
- Base night vision brightness can be adjusted.

### __Configuration__

- _Client_: `no_nv_flash-client.toml` file located in `/config`

### __Compatibility__

This mod does use a mixin (ASM) as of 1.16 and may have some compatibility issues, but it is very unlikely.

This mod is completely standalone and has no dependencies. It can safely be included in modpacks.
