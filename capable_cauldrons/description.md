This is a very simple mod - it enables Forge capabilities for the Cauldron Block, which allows all sorts of various mods to interact with it the same way that they would interact with each other.

For example, Fluiducts from [Thermal Dynamics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-dynamics) can be used to insert and extract fluid, as shown below. You'll notice that pistons are still able to move Cauldrons, so there is absolutely no change to vanilla behavior.

This mod has no dependencies but does use mixins! Happy Cauldroning. :)
