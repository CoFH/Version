CoFH Core has been around a long time (Since 2013!) and has changed throughout its various iterations.

__Information that you read on various wikis may be outdated or no longer apply.__

Please read the overviews under "Historical" to get an idea what the mod offers for a given version of Minecraft. Note that required and optional dependencies have changed with time. We apologize for the changes, but the nature of Minecraft modding is such that flexibility is required to maintain features in an ever-changing codebase.

### __Configuration__

- _Client_: `cofh_core-client.toml` file located in `/config`
- _Server_: `cofh_core-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.

Copying this file to your `/defaultconfigs` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.

Dedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`
