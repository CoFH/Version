Thermal Technology marches on. Adds Thermal-style tools and equipment!

For nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.

The Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.

As a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.

This module contains "Innovation" - a collection of things which increase player-centric power - useful tools, gadgets, and armor.

The mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.

### __Configuration__

- _Client_: `thermal-client.toml` file located in `/config`
- _Server_: `thermal-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.

Copying this file to your `/defaultsconfig` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.

Dedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`

## __Features__

This section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.

WIP - Thanks for your patience.
