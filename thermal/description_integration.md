Thermal integrates with others!

For nearly a decade, the Thermal Series mods have been a cornerstone of modded gameplay. They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.

The Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.

As a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.

This module contains "Integration" - all of the compatibility materials, recipes, and enhancements to make the Thermal Series play even better alongside some common - and not so common - mods. The goal is to blend both style and functionality without compromising or unbalancing the larger modded ecosystem, so config options are in place to quickly disable entire feature sets.

The mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.
