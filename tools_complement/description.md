Tool's Complement adds weapons and armor for most standard metals. A lot of this was once in Thermal Foundation in 1.12.

This mod has been redesigned to be more Vanilla+ friendly, though it still plays well alongside the Thermal Series.

__This mod requires CoFH Core. It can be found here: [CoFH Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cofh-core)__

### __Configuration__

- _Client_: `tools_complement-client.toml` file located in `/config`
- _Server_: `tools_complement-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.

Copying this file to your `/defaultconfigs` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.

Dedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`

## __Features__
