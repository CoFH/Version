Oh My Gourd is a pretty straightforward mod - it adds new variants of Carved Pumpkin and Jack o'Lantern.

__This mod requires CoFH Core. It can be found here: [CoFH Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cofh-core)__

### __Configuration__

- _Client_: `omgourd-client.toml` file located in `/config`
- _Server_: `omgourd-server.toml` located in the `/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs` folder.

Copying this file to your `/defaultconfigs` folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.

Dedicated servers will have this file in `/world/serverconfigs`

## __Features__

This section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.

There are currently 24 new variants for Pumpkins and Jack o'Lanterns.

- Using Shears on a standard Carved Pumpkin / Jack o'Lantern will change them to these new variants, as shown below.

- Continue using Shears to change the face. Durability will not be used!
- Sneak-using Shears will go "back" one carving, in case you overshoot.
